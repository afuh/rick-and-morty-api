### What is this?
The Rick and Morty API (or ShlaAPI) is a RESTful API based on the television show [Rick and Morty](https://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty). You will access to data about hundreds of characters, images, locations and episodes. We still gathering data, because as you probably know, there are trillions of characters and locations. The Rick and Morty API is filled with canonical information as seen on the TV show, we are planing to add more resources such as the [comic series](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Rick_and_Morty_(comic_series)) or [Pocket Mortys](https://pocketmortys.net/).

### Who are you?
I am [Axel Fuhrmann](http://axelfuhrmann.com), a guy who recently started to develop things.

### Did you build the API alone?
No, [Talita](https://talitatraveler.wordpress.com/) helped me a lot. She is in charge of the research and the data entry.

### Why did you build this?
Because I was really interested in the idea of writing an API and also because Rick and Morty is our favorite show at the moment, so why not?.

### Are you a native english speaker?
No, I am not. If you find typos, grammar errors or whatever please feel free to [PR](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api) or send me an [email](mailto:axelfuh@gmail.com).

### Technical stuff?
I'm using [Node](https://nodejs.org) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) to serve the API, all the data is formated in [json](http://json.org/) and I'm hosting the entire project in [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).

### Can I contribute to the project?
Of course, the API is an open source project and you can contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api).
